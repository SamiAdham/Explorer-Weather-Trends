# Project Task:
The project is to show the similarities and differences between my city and global by using visualization chart. Also, to prepare a PDF documents explain all the steps, results and comments. 

# Goals:
1.	How to extract the data from database using SQL query.
2.	How to use statistical equation to answer real-life question. Such as comparison between nearest city avg. temperature and global avg. temperature. 
3.	How to use chart visualization to represent your result.

# Tools:
1.	SQL query to extract data from UDACITY remote server and download it as .CSV format.
2.	I preferred using python through Jupyter notebook (ANACONDA)  to take a chance to practice in this first project for future projects. 

# Project Steps:
* Step#1: Extract Data from database using SQL query
*	Step#2: Analyze data to solve problem by Python (Equations, Methods, Libraries, Charts)
*	Step#3: Observation and result
